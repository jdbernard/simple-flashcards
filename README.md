Simple Flashcards takes a set of text values, one value per line, and shows
them to the user one at a time. It has the following features:

* Configurable timing between cards.
* Configurable size of the text (small, medium, and large).
* In-order, reverse-order, and random-order traversal of the cards.
* Support for saving/loading settings and inputs (locally to the browser).
* Support for importing/exporting saved card sets as a file.

Simple Flashcards is available at http://flashcards.jdbernard.com
